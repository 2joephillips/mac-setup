# Java {#java}

Check if Java is already installed

```
$ java -version

```

If you see an output like below then Java is already installed on your machine so skip the next step.

```
java version "1.8.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_45-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.45-b02, mixed mode)

```

If you don't see the output like above then you need to install Java on your system. Please download the OS X version from the[Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Check if Java is correctly installed by running the`java -version`command again.

Add`JAVA_HOME`to your environment variables by adding the line below to your`env.sh`.

    export JAVA_HOME="`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`"


You should have JAVA working now. You can use[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)or[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)as your Java IDE.
