# Mac OS X Setup Guide

This book covers the basics of setting up a development environment on a new MacBook for most major languages. All instructions covered have been tested on El Capitain. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone to use as a reference when installing some languages/libraries.

We will set up [Node](http://nodejs.org) \(JavaScript\), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) , and several IDEs. Even if you don't program in both, it is good to have them, as many command-line tools use one of them. We also install a few daily use applications. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to send me any feedback or comments you may have.

All contributions to the book are welcome. Please help add support for other libraries and languages.

**Looking for contributors to maintain and extend the documentation more**
