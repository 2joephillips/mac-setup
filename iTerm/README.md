## iTerm2

Since we're going to be spending a lot of time in the command-line, let's install a better terminal than the default one. Download and install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/).

In **Finder**, drag and drop the **iTerm** Application file into the **Applications** folder.

You can now launch iTerm, through the **Launchpad** for instance.

Let's just quickly change some preferences.

### Colors and Font Settings

* Set hotkey to open and close the terminal to `command + shift + i`
* Go to profiles -&gt; Default -&gt; Terminal -&gt; Check silence bell
* Download [one of iTerm2 color schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/schemes) from here, or [my personal favs.](https://gist.github.com/2joephillips) And then set these to your default profile colors.
* Want something really fun.... Check out [this](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/iterm2-material-design)... :\)
* Change the font to 14pt Source Code Pro Lite. Source Code Pro can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/latest).
