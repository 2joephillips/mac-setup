## iTerm2

Since we're going to be spending a lot of time in the command-line, let's install a better terminal than the default one. Download and install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/).

In **Finder**, drag and drop the **iTerm** Application file into the **Applications** folder.

You can now launch iTerm, through the **Launchpad** for instance.

Let's just quickly change some preferences.

### Colors and Font Settings
- Go to profiles -> Default -> Terminal -> Check silence bell
- Change the cursor text and cursor color to yellow make it more visible
- Change the font to 18pt Source Code Pro Lite. Source Code Pro can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/latest).
- Download [Material Shell](https://gist.github.com/2joephillips/06150f60cbd4b2e0289fcc269b1c9162) from here. And then set these to your default profile colors.
