# Atom Text Editor

A lot of people are also starting to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as their goto text editor.

Go ahead and [download](https://atom.io/) it. Open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder, you know the drill now. Launch the application.

Atom is not free, and as a comprehensive list of [packages](https://atom.io/packages) and [themes](https://atom.io/themes).

After installation you can open a file with `$ atom myfile.py` or start a new project in the current directory with `$ atom .`. Pretty cool. We'll configure Sublime more in the next few sections.
